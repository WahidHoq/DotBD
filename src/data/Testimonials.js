      "We had looked into availing ERP services since 2014, specifically from a local vendor. The vendor we choose would have to have experience, have the ability to anticipate our information management requirements, and have a team with the confidence to undertake a project with requirements. </br> Our research showed Dot Bangladesh may be the company. </br> Dot Bangladesh has a highly experienced team, their support and continued feedback during the customization allowed us to keep track of the work.

      "We have been working with Dot Bangladesh for more than 1 year, in Android development and server-side (Asp.Net) development. Our project is complex and unique, and required resourceful professionals, with in-depth knowledge of the platform. Their know-how, particularly in the Android arena, allowed us to significantly reduce the time-to-market, by building the solution we had envisaged much quicker than we had planned, but still within a reasonable cost. We would expect that, in such a short delivery cycle, the source code would be quick & dirty, but it's not - it's well design, easy to understand and with an architecture that allows us to grow the solution without having to rebuild the foundations. Besides the technical competences, the team is results-driven and customer oriented, creating an atmosphere that leads all stakeholders to work together towards a single objective - the successful completion of the project.",
